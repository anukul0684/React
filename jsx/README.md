# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### The recommended method for generating a project is now:

npx create-react-app my-app

If you get any errors about missing templates or how a global Create React App install is no longer supported even when using this command, you likely need to remove the global package from your system:

npm uninstall -g create-react-app

- Note - some students have mentioned that an extra step was needed for Mac / Linux users to manually delete the folder:

rm -rf /usr/local/bin/create-react-app

### Important Note about Live Reloading

There appears to be an issue in CRA in regards to fast refresh when code changes are made to the index.js file:

https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/9904

Manually refreshing will show the changes, also, any changes to components deeper in the file structure will cause an auto-refresh as expected.

## One workaround noted suggests putting the following in the index.js which enables reloading:

## Important - You must restart your server after making this change

if (module.hot) {
module.hot.accept();
}

## Note - If you have spaces in your project directory name, reloading throughout the whole application can also fail.
